CPP program solving the behavior of bubble population in homogeneous space domain. Coalescence, bubble release from the space domain and mass 
transfer are included in the model. The population balance equation is solved using a DQMOM method. The final ordinary differential equations 
are numerically solved using a Runge-Kutta technique at the fourth order.
